RC3 CHANGES
---------------
1.) The module will now keep your username and password to aid upgrades.
2.) Further tweaks to the Installation because of users reporting the same error about openssl.
3.) Added options to let the user select HTML or Text emails.
4.) In the form block, if a user who is already subscribed tries to subscribe they would have previously been re-subscribed, now the module will NOT let let people re-subscribe, they have to login and update their subscription or use the constantcontact.com website, this is to avoid overwriting the lists people are subscribed to if the APi is used elsewhere.
5.) You can now set the position of the email field that appears within the form block.
6.) The module now uses the drupal function module_load_include() instead of require_once.
7.) Fixed a bug with the way class.cc.php handled chunked data.

RC1 CHANGES
---------------
Account edit page now checks if the user is registered with constant contact and automatically checks the checkbox if the user email is found and they are set to active status, this will mean people who signed up using a different method (through the block method for example) will be correctly flagged as subscribed.

The duplicated newsletter section which appears when you have other account page tabs has been removed.

The newsletter section on the account edit page is now expanded by default.

The account edit page custom fields has been fixed, these should work correctly now and update the extra fields with constant contact when they appear within a new tab.

See http://drupal.org/node/671666 for reference to these bugs.

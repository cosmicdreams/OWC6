DESCRIPTION AND BENEFITS
------------------------

The SEO Checklist module provides a list of good SEO actions that you should
take to maximize the presence of your website in the major search engines. It
provides little functionality itself but rather it helps you keep track of what
needs to be done and what has been completed already.

Search Engines Drive 90% of the traffic on the web. The more "findable" you are,
the easier it is for you to get customers. This module helps you with on-page
SEO - a necessary component of a good online marketing campaign.


INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

SEO Checklist is installed in the usual way. See
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7. To start using
the module, go to admin/settings/seo-checklist. It will pre-check any completed
items it is able to auto detect. Start working through the rest, and click
"Save" to save your progress!


UPGRADING FROM 3.x
------------------

IMPORTANT: As with any other irreversible change, you should backup your
database before attempting to upgrade the SEO Checklist!

With the 4.x branch the module machine name was changed to match the Drupal.org
project name, so Drupal won't recognize it as the same module anymore. You'll
need to re-enable it from the Modules page (admin/modules). When installed, it
will remove the residue of the old module name itself.

Additionally, the module now depends on the Checklist API
(http://drupal.org/project/checklistapi), which you'll need to install before
you can enable the new version.

Your saved progress from the 3.x version of the module will be preserved when
you update.

- Volacci spent numerous hours in research and development on this module. We
  want to maintain it and keep good SEO advice available to the entire
  community. Instead of asking for donations or bounties for this module, we
  request that you include a simple link back to us somewhere on your website.
  When you're done (or before) go down to the "Link to Volacci" task and check
  it! That will automatically add a link to Volacci in your website's footer.
  If you want to link to us but not in your footer, uncheck the box and put
  the link to http://www.volacci.com/ wherever you want to. Thanks for the link!
  If you e-mail us (seochecklist [at] volacci.com) and tell us where your link
  is, we'll link back to you! As you may know, links help move your site up in
  the search engines. (See http://www.volacci.com/why-links-help-seo.)

- Enjoy using the module!

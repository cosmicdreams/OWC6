Panopoly News
=============

Panopoly News is both a simple news content application and a great starting point for 
building more robust and powerful news applications. It installs pre-configured with 
sane defaults so you can immediately focus on adding content instead of spending time 
with difficult setup. 

Demo Content

Panopoly News ships with demonstration content so you can get a feel for
the kind of functionality provided. Click on the "Disable demo content"
link on the news page or disable the module to turn this off.

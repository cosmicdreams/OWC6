gulp-exec
===========

[exec](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp)

Usage
-----

```javascript
var exec = require('gulp-exec');

gulp.task('reset', function() {
  var options = {
    silent: true,
    customTemplatingThing: "test"
  };
  gulp.src('./**/**')
    .pipe(exec('git checkout <%= file.path %> <%= options.customTemplatingThing %>', options));
});
```

Note this now uses `gulp-util` for templating, a breaking change from previous versions.
